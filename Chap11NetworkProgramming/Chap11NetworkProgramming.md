# 11.1 The Client-Server Programming Model
* Every network application is based on **Client-Server Programming Model**.
* In Client-Server Programming Model, an application consist of **a server process** and **one or more client processes**.
* A server manages some **resources** and it provides some **service** for clients by manipulating the resource.
* In Client-Server Programming Model, the fundamental operation is **transaction**.
* A Client-Server transaction consists of 4 steps:
  1. When a client need a service, it initiates a transaction by sending a request to a server.
  2. The server receives the request, interprets it, and manipulating its resources in the appropriate way (such as read a disk file, etc).
  3. The server sends a response to the client and wait for the next request.
  4. The client receives the response and manipulate it (such as display it on screen, etc).
* Clients and servers are **processes** but **not** machines.
* A single host can run many different clients and servers **concurrently**.

# 11.2 Networks
* To a host, a network is just another I/O device that serves as a source and sink for data.
![HardwareOrganizationOfNetworkHost](./Figure11_2.JPG)
* The most popular LAN (Local Area Network) is **Ethernet**.
* An Ethernet segment consists of some **wire** (twisted pairs of wires) and a **hub**.
![EthernetSegment](./Figure11_3.JPG)
* Each Ethernet adaptor has a global **unique 48bit address** that is stored in a **nonvolatile** memory on the adaptor.
  * A host can send a chunk of bits called a **frame** to other host on the memory.
  * Each frame includes **header** bits that identify **source** and **destination** of the frame and the **length** of the frame, then a payload of **data** bits.
  * Every host adaptor sees the frame, but **only** the destination host reads it.
* Multiple Ethernet segments can be connected to the larget LANs, called **bridged Ethernets**, using sets of wires and small boxes called **bridges**.
![BridgedEthernetSegments](./Figure11_4.JPG)
* At a higher level in the hierarchy, multiple incompatible LANs can be connected by specialized computers called **Routers** to form an **internet**
* Routers can also connect high-speed point-to-point phone connections which is WANs (Wide Area Networks).
* Routers can be used to build internets from arbitrary collections of LANs and WANs. 
![ASmallInternet](./Figure11_6.JPG)
* How to send data from one host to another destination of host across all incompatible networks? 
  * Protocol software that is running on each host and router.
  * Protocol must provide 2 basic capabilities:
    * Naming Scheme - assign each host an unique internet address.
    * Delivery Mechanism - bundle up data into **packets**.
      * A packet contains a **header** and a **payload**.
* Example:
![DataTravelOneHostToAnother](./Figure11_7.JPG)
  1. Client on host A invokes a **system call** to copy the data from client's virtual address space into a **kernel buffer**.
  2. **Protocol software** on host A creates a LAN1 frame by appending an **internet packet header (PH)** and **LAN1 frame header** to the data.
    * PH is addressed to internet host B.
    * FH is addressed to the router.
  3. LAN1 adaptor copies the frame to the network.
  4. The **router's LAN1 adaptor** receives the frame and passes it to the **protocol software**.
  5. Construct new frame:
     * The router get the destination internet address from PH.
     * The router use the destination address as an index to the router table to determine where to forward the packet.
     * The router strip off the old LAN1 header (FH) and append new LAN2 header addresses to host B.
     * The router pass the new frame to the adaptor.
  6. LAN2 adaptor receives the frame.
  7. The frame reaches host B. The adaptor pass it to **protocol software**.
  8. The protocol software strip off PH and FH. The protocol software will copy the data to the server's virtual address.

# 11.3 The Global IP Internet
* The basic hardware and software organization of an Internet client-server application:
  ![HWandSW](./Figure11_8.JPG)
* Each Internet host runs software that implements the **TCP/IP protocol (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol)**.
* Internet clients and servers communicate using a mix of **sockets interface functions** and **Unix I/O functions**.
* TCP/IP is actually a family of protocols.
* Datagrams: packets.
* UDP: unreliable datagram protocol.
* Internet Properties:
  * Hosts are mapped to **32bit IP addresses**.
    * IPv4 - 32bit address.
    * IPv6 - 128bit address.
  * IP Addresses are mapped to **Internet Domain Names**.
  * A process on one Internet host can communicate with a process on any other Internet host over a **connection**.
## 11.3.1 IP Addresses
* Network stores IP addresses in **IP address structure** below:
  ```
    struct in_addr{
        uint32_t    s_addr; /* Big-endian */
    }
  ```
* TCP/IP defines a uniform **network byte order** (big-endian byte order) for any integer data item.
* IP address format: **dotted decimal notation**.
  * 128.2.194.242 = 0x8002c2f2.
  ```
    linux> hostname -i  /* determine the dotted decimal address of your own host */
    128.2.194.242
  ```
  * Application program can convert back and forth between **IP addresses** and **dotted-decimal string**.
## 11.3.2 Internet Domain Names
* IP addresses map to **Domain Names**.
* The mapping is maintained in a distributed worldwide database known as **DNS (Domain Name System)**.
* Example - whaleshark.ics.cs.cmu.edu
  ![InternetDomainNameHierarchy](./Figure11_10.png)
  * First-level domain names:
    * Defined by ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) organization.
    * Includes com, edu, gov, org and net.
* Each Internet Host has the locally defined domain name **localhost**, which is always mapped to **loopback** address: 127.0.0.1.
  ```
    yd@ubuntu:~$ nslookup localhost
    Server:		127.0.0.53
    Address:	127.0.0.53#53

    Non-authoritative answer:
    Name:	localhost
    Address: 127.0.0.1
    Name:	localhost
    Address: ::1
  ```
* **'Hostname'** to determine the real domain name of the local host. **'nslookup'** to determine the localhost ip address:
  ```
    yd@ubuntu:~$ hostname
    ubuntu
    yd@ubuntu:~$ nslookup ubuntu
    Server:		127.0.0.53
    Address:	127.0.0.53#53

    Non-authoritative answer:
    Name:	ubuntu
    Address: 127.0.1.1
  ```
  ```
    yd@ubuntu:~$ nslookup www.baidu.com
    Server:		127.0.0.53
    Address:	127.0.0.53#53

    Non-authoritative answer:
    www.baidu.com	canonical name = www.a.shifen.com.
    Name:	www.a.shifen.com
    Address: 180.101.49.11
    Name:	www.a.shifen.com
    Address: 180.101.49.12
  ```
* Sometimes, multiple domain names are mapped to the same IP address.
## 11.3.3 Internet Connections
* A **connection** is point-to-point that it connects a pair of **processes**.
* A **socket** is an **end point** of a connection.
  * Each socket has a **socket address** consisting of an **Internet Address** and a **16bit integer port**.
  * The **port** in the **client**'s socket address is assigned automatically by the kernel, when a client make a request and is known as a **ephemeral port**.
  * The port in the **server**'s socket address is well-known port that is permanently associated with the service.
    * Web servers use port 80.
    * Email servers use port 25. 
  * The well-known service name for the Web service is aasociated with a well-know port.
    * Web service - http.
    * Email - smtp.
  * The mapping between well-known names and well-known ports is stored in a file (/etc/services).
* A connection is identified by **socket pair** (2 end-point socket addresses). Socket pair:
  * Format - **cliaddr:cliport, servaddr:servport**.
  * Example (Web client socket address):
    ```
      128.2.194.242:51213
    ```
    * Client address: 128.2.194.242.
    * Ephemeral port: 51213.
  * Example (Web server's socket address):
    ```
      208.216.181.15:80
    ```
    * Server address: 208.216.181.15.
    * Port: 80 - http/tcp.
  * Socket pair: (128.2.194.242:51213, 208.216.181.15:80).

# 11.4 The Socket Interface
* The **socket interface** is a set of **functions** that are used in with Unix I/O functions to build network application.
* _in means internet.
![SocketInterfaceOfNetworkApplication](./Figure11_12.png)
## 11.4.1 Socket Address Structures
```
  /* IP socket address structure */
  struct sockaddr_in {
  uint16_t  sin_family;     /* Protocol family (always AF_INET) */
  uint16_t  sin_port;       /* Port number in network byte order */
  struct in_addr sin_addr;  /* IP address  in network byte order */
  unsigned char sin_zero[8]; /* Pad to sizeof(struct sockaddr) */
  };
  
  /* Generic socket address structure (for connect, bind, and accept) */
  struct sockaddr {
  uint16_t sa_family; /* Protocol family */
  char  sa_data[14];  /* Address data */
  };
```
* For Linux kernel, a socket is **an end point for communication**.
* For Linux Program, a socket is an open file with descriptor.
```
  typedef struct sockaddr SA;
```
## 11.4.2 The **socket** Function
* Client and server use **socket function** to create **a socket descriptor**.
```
  #include <sys/types.h>
  #include <sys/socket.h>
  int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);
```
* How to call socket:
  ```
    clientfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
  ```
## 11.4.3 The **connect** Function
* A client establish a connection with a server by calling the **connect** function.
```
  #include <sys/socket.h>
  int connect(int clientfd, const struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen);
  Returns: 0 if OK, âˆ’1 on error
```
* If the connection succeeds, the clientfd is ready for reading and writing.
* The resulting connection is characterized by the socket pair:
  ```
    (x:y, addr.sin_addr:addr.sin_port)
  ```
## 11.4.4 The **bind** Function
* **bind, listen and accept** are used for servers to establish connection with clients.
  ```
    #include <sys/socket.h>
    int bind(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen);
    Returns: 0 if OK, âˆ’1 on error
  ```
  * **bind** function asks kernel to associate the server's **socket address in addr** with the **socket descriptor socketfd**.
  * Should use **getaddrinfo** to supply argument to bind.
## 11.4.5 The **listen** Function
* A server calls **listen** function to tell kernel that the socket will be used by a server instead of a client.
  ```
    #include <sys/socket.h>
    int listen(int sockfd, int backlog);
    Returns: 0 if OK, âˆ’1 on error
  ```
    * listen convert sockfd from an active socket to a **listening socket** that can accept connect request from clients.
## 11.4.6 The **accept** Function
```
  #include <sys/socket.h>
  int accept(int listenfd, struct sockaddr *addr, int *addrlen);
  Returns: nonnegative connected descriptor if OK, âˆ’1 on error
```
* Accept function:
  * Waits for a **connection request** from a client to arrive on listen descriptor **listenfd**.
  * **Fills** in client's socket descriptor in addr.
  * Returns a **connected** descriptor.
  ![ListenAndConnect](./Figure11_14.png)
## 11.4.7 Host and Service Conversion
### The **getaddrinfo** function
* getaddrinfo converts strings of hostnames, host addresses, service names and port numbers into socket address structures.
  ```
    #include <sys/types.h>
    #include <sys/socket.h>
    #include <netdb.h>
    int getaddrinfo(const char *host, const char *service, const struct addrinfo *hints, struct addrinfo **result);
    Returns: 0 if OK, nonzero error code on error
    void freeaddrinfo(struct addrinfo *result);
    Returns: nothing
    const char *gai_strerror(int errcode);
    Returns: error message
  ```
    * 'result' points to a linked list of addrinfo structures which point to a socket address structure.
    * 'host' can be a domain name or a numeric address.
    * 'service' can be a service name or a decimal port number.
  ```
    struct addrinfo {
        int     ai_flags;       /* Hints argument flags */
        int     ai_family;      /* First arg to socket function */
        int     ai_socktype;    /* Second arg to socket function */
        int     ai_protocol;    /* Third arg to socket function */
        char    *ai_canonname;  /* Canonical hostname */
        size_t  ai_addrlen;     /* Size of ai_addr struct */
        struct sockaddr *ai_addr; /* Ptr to socket address structure */
        struct addrinfo *ai_next; /* Ptr to next item in linked list */
    };
  ```
    * ai_family: AF_INET=IPv4 address, AF_INET6=IPv6 address.
    * ai_socktype: SOCK_STREAM - restrict the list to **at most one addrinfo structure** for each unique address.
    * ai_flags: can use or to use various values at the same time.
      * AI_ADDRCONFIG: recommended if using connections.
      * AI_CANONNAME: instructs getaddrinfo to point the **ai_canonname field** in the **first** addrinfo structure in the list to the canonical (official) name.
      * AI_NUMERICSERV: force the service argument to be a port number.
      * AI_PASSIVE: instructs to return socket addresses that can be used by servers as **listening sockets**.
of host
### The **getnameinfo** Function
* getnameinfo is the inverse of getaddrinfo, which converts a socket address structure to host and service name strings.
```
  #include <sys/socket.h>
  #include <netdb.h>
  int getnameinfo(const struct sockaddr *sa, socklen_t salen, char *host, size_t hostlen, char *service, size_t servlen, int flags);
  Returns: 0 if OK, nonzero error code on error
```
  * The host or service name strings will be copies to 'host' or 'service'.
  * flags:
    * NI_NUMERICHOST: force getnameinfo to return a numeric address string as a domain name in host.
    * NI_NUMERICSERV: 
      * By default, getnameinfo will lookinto /etc/services and return a service name.
      * Setting NI_NUMERICSERV will force getnameinfo to return port number without looking into /etc/services.
## 11.4.8 Helper Function for the Sockets Interface
* Higher level helper function: open_clientfd, open_listenfd.
### open_clientfd
```
  #include "csapp.h"
    int open_clientfd(char *hostname, char *port);
    Returns: descriptor if OK, âˆ’1 on error
```
* A client **establishes a connection** with a server by calling open_clientfd running on host 'hostname' and listening for connection requests on port number 'port'.
* Codes:
  ```
    int open_clientfd(char *hostname, char *port)
    {
      int clientfd;
      struct addrinfo hints, *listp, *p;

      /* Get a list of server sock address structures */
      memset(&hints, 0, sizeof(struct addrinfo));
      hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;  // return at most one addrinfo structure 
      hints.ai_flags = AI_NUMERICSERV;  // force the 'service' argument to be a port number
      hints.ai_flag |= AI_ADDRCONFIG;   // recommended if using connections
      getaddrinfo(hostname, port, &hints, &listp);  // get sock address structure 'listp'

      for(p = listp; p; p = p->ai_next)
      {
        // Create Socket. if socket function failed, continue next loop
        if((clientfd = socket(p->ai_family, p->ai_socktype, p->ai_protocol)) < 0)
          continue;

        // Connect to the server. If connect successfully, break the loop.
        if(connect(clientfd, p->ai_address, p->ai_addrlen)!=-1)
          break;
        close(clientfd);
      }

      Freeaddrinfo(listp);
      if(!p) return -1;
      else return clientfd; // return successful connect
    }
  ```
### open_listenfd
* A server creates a listening descriptor that is ready to recieve connection requests by calling open_listenfd function.
```
  int open_listenfd(char* port)
  {
    struct addrinfo hints, *listp, *p;
    int listenfd, optval=1;

    /* Get a list of potential server addresses */
    memset(&hints, 0, sizeof(struct addrinfo));
    hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;
    hints.ai_flags  = AI_PASSIVE | AI_ADDRCONFIG; // be listening socket | recommend
    hints.ai_flags |= AI_NUMERICSERV; // force the 'service' argument to be a port number
    getaddrinfo(NULL, port, &hints, &listp);

    /* Walk through the address list and find the one to bind */
    for(p=listp;p;p=p->ai_next)
    {
      // Create a socket descriptor
      if((listenfd = socket(p->ai_family,p->ai_socktype,p->ai_protocol))<0)
        continue;

      // Set sock option. Eliminate "address already in use" error from bind
      setsockopt(listenfd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, (const void*)&optval, sizeof(int));

      // Bind the descriptor to the address
      if(bind(listenfd, p->ai_address, p->ai_addrlen)==0)
        break; // if bind successfully, break the loop. 

      close(listenfd); // if bind failed, close current listenfd, try next p.
    }

    // Clean up
    Freeaddrinfo(listp);
    if(!p) return -1; // if no address works, return -1.

    // Make listenfd a listen socket and ready to accept connections. If not, close and return.
    if(listen(listenfd, LISTENQ)<0)
    {
      close(listenfd);
      return -1;
    }

    return listenfd;
  }
```
## 11.4.9 Example Echo Client and Server
* Echo client main routine:
```
  #include "csapp.h"
  int main(int argc, char** argv)
  {
    int clientfd;
    char *host,*port,buf[MAX_LINE];
    rio_t rio;

    if(argc != 3)
    {
      fprintf(stderr, "usage: %s <host> <port>\n", argv[0]);
      exit(0);
    }
    host = argv[1];
    port = argv[2];

    clientfd = open_clientfd(host, port);
    rio_readinitb(&rio, clientfd);  // Associate descriptor clientfd with a read buffer of type rio_t at address rio

    while(fgets(buf, MAX_LINE, stdin) != NULL)
    {
      rio_written(clientfd, buf, strlen(buf));  // transfer data in buf to desciptor clientfd (transfer data to server)
      rio_readlineb(&rio,buf,MAX_LINE); // read from file rio (server) to buf with MAX_LINE-1 bytes
      fputs(buf, stdout);
    }
    
    close(clientfd);
    exit(0);
  }
```
* Echo server main routine:
```
  #include "csapp.h"
  int main(int argc, char** argv)
  {
    int listenfd, connfd;
    socklen_t clientlen;
    struct sockaddr_storage clientaddr;
    char client_hostname[MAX_LINE], client_port[MAX_LINE];

      printf("Connected to (%s %s)\n", client_hostname, client_port);
      echo(connfd);
      close(connfd);
    }
    exit(0);
  }
```
  * can only handle one client and it's an **iterative** server.
* echo routine:
```
  #incldue "csapp.h"
  void echo(int connfd)
  {
    size_t n;
    char buf[MAX_LINE];
    rio_t rio;

    rio_readinitb(&rio, connfd);
    while((n = rio_readlineb(&rio, buf, MAX_LINE))!=0)
    {
      printf("server received %d bytes \n", (int)n);
      rio_written(connfd, buf, n);
    }
  }
```
# 11.5 Web Servers
## 11.5.1 Web Basics
* Web clients and servers interact using HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol).
* Web content can be written in a language called HTML (hypertext markup language).
## 11.5.2 Web Contect
* For Web clients and servers, content is **a sequence of bytes** with associated MIME type.
  * MIME - multipurpose internet mail extensions.
  ```
    text/html               // HTML page
    text/plain              // Unformatted text
    application/postscript  // Postscript document
    image/gif               // Binary image encoded in GIF format
    image/png               // Binary image encoded in PNG format
    image/jpeg              // Binary image encoded in JPEG format
  ```
* Web servers provide content to clients in 2 ways:
  * Fetch a disk file and return its content to the client.
    * static content - serving static content.
  * Run an executable file and return its output to the client.
    * dynamic content - serving dynamic content.
* Each of returned file is known as URL (universal resource locator).
```
  http://bluefish.ics.cs.cmu.edu:8000/cgi-bin/adder?15000&213
```
  * Identify an executable called '/cgi-bin/adder'.
  * 2 arguments: 15000, 213.
  * '?' separates the filename and arguments.
  * '&' separates argements and arguments.
## 11.5.3 HTTP Transactions
### HTTP Requests
* A HTTP request consists of a request line, 0 or more request headers and an empty text line.
* Request line format:
  ```
    method URI version
  ```
  * HTTP supports methods including GET, POST, OPTIONS, HEAD, PUT, DELETE and TRACE.
  * version indicates HTTP version.
* Request header format:
  ```
    header-name: header-data
  ```
  * host header is used by **proxy caches**.
    * Proxy caches sometimes serve as intermediaries between a browser and the origin server that manages the requested file.
### HTTP Responses
* A HTTP response consist of a response line, 0 or more response headers, an empty line and response body.
* Response line:
  ```
    version status-code status-message
  ```
  * version: http version.
  * status-code: 3-digit positive integer.
  ![status-code](./Figure11_25.png)
  * status-message: English equivalent of the error code.
* Response header:
  * content-type: MINE type.
  * content-length.
## 11.5.4 Serving Dynamic Content
* How Does the Client Pass Program Arguments to the Server?
  * '?' + '&'.
* How Does the Server Pass Arguments to the Child?
  * Example: GET /cgi-bin/adder?15000&213 HTTP/1.1
    * Server receives the request.
    * Server calls fork to create a child process and calls execve to run /cgi-bin/adder.
    * Common Gateway Interface, or CGI, is a set of standards that define how information is exchanged between the web server and a custom script.
* How Does the Server Pass Other Information to the Child?
  * Use other CGI environment variable.
* Where Does the Child Send Its Output?
  * CGI program sends its dynamic content to the standard output
* Example - CGI program that sums 2 arguments and return an HTML file.
``` Example - sums 2 arguments and return an HTML file
  #include "csapp.h"
  int main(void)
  {
    char *buf, *p;
    char arg1[MAX_LINE], arg2[MAX_LINE], content[MAX_LINE];
    int n1=0, n2=0;

    /* Extract 2 argument to arg1 and arg2 */
    if((buf = getenv("QUERY_STRING"))!=NULL)
    {
      p = strchr(buff, '&');  // search in the buff for '&'. Return the pointer to '&'.
      *p = '\0';
      strcpy(arg1, buff);
      strcpy(arg2, p+1);
      n1 = atoi(arg1);
      n2 = atoi(arg2);
    }

    /* Make the Response Body */
    sprintf(content, "QUERY_STRING=%s", buf);  // sends formatted output to a string pointed to, by content.
    sprintf(content, "Welcome to add.com: ");
    sprintf(content, "%sThe Internet addition portal.\r\n<p>",content);
    sprintf(content, "%sThe answer is: %d + %d = %d\r\n<p>",content,n1,n2,n1+n2);
    sprintf(content, "%sThanks for visiting!\r\n",content);

    /* Generate the HTTP response */
    printf("Connection close\r\n");
    printf("Content-length: %d\r\n",(int)strlen(content));
    printf("Content-type: text/html\r\n\r\n");

# 11.6 Put it together: **tiny** Web Server
* Example to realize:
![HTTP_Transaction](./Figure11_24.png)

# 11.7 Summary
* Clients and servers establish connections by using **socket interface**.
  * A socket is an end point of connection that is presented to applications in the **form of a file descriptor**.
  * Socket interface provides functions for opening and closing socket descriptor.
  * Client and servers communicate with each other by reading and writing these descriptors.
* CGI standard provides a set of rules that govern how the client passes arguments to the server, how the server passes arguments and other information to the child process, and how the child sends its output back to the client.
